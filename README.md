## Project Description

This project was made as a part of the course *Advanced Software Engineering*, held by the Seoul National University of Science and Technology in the Fall 2023 Semester.

We were tasked to develop a to-do app that allows users to create and organize tasks based on a set of mandatory and custom requirements in the form of user stories.

The development focuses on using an agile methodology assisted by the use of generative AI to improve the software engineering process.
